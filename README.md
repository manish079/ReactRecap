# Whenever the state is updated, React efficiently re-renders the component. It does this in a highly optimized way using the Virtual DOM, which makes UI updates extremely fast and seamless.

# Diff Algorithm (Reconciliation algo / react fiber) -> Under the hood of react working

# Virtual dom

- virtual dom is representation of actual DOM
